# My Resume Website

Hey there! 👋 This is my personal resume website - a clean, modern portfolio built with React.

## What's This?

Just my resume, but make it interactive and pretty. It's hosted on GitHub Pages and showcases my experience, skills, and projects in a way that's a bit more engaging than a PDF.

## Features

- 📄 Interactive resume with smooth scrolling sections
- 🖨️ Print-friendly resume format (because sometimes you still need paper)
- 📊 Privacy-friendly analytics (no cookies, no tracking nonsense)
- 📱 Fully responsive - looks good on your phone, tablet, or desktop
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight - no bloat, just the essentials

## Tech Stack

- React
- Modern CSS with custom animations
- Deployed on GitHub Pages

## Running Locally

If you want to check it out locally (though honestly, you can just visit the live site):

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

## Note

This is a personal project, so I'm not looking for contributions. Feel free to browse the code if you're curious, but I'm keeping this one to myself. 😊
